# You can use wildcard records to create specific names for every domain you add to mailcow.
# Example: Add domains "example.com" and "example.net" to mailcow, change ADDITIONAL_SAN to a value like:
#ADDITIONAL_SAN=imap.*,smtp.*
# This will expand the certificate to "imap.example.com", "smtp.example.com", "imap.example.net", "imap.example.net"
# plus every domain you add in the future.
#
# You can also just add static names...
#ADDITIONAL_SAN=srv1.example.net

#ADDITIONAL_SAN=imap.*,srv1.example.com
